# Modules Advantages in Terraform
Basically modules helps us in Maintaing, Collaborating, ReUsability, Ownership, Scalability and there are more as such but we 
discuss as a few.

1. Modularity:    It helps in managing the infrastructure by segregating the modules because you will have different modules
                  for the services which you are writing and each module has it's own functionality such as EC2, S3, VPC e.t.c
2. Resusability:  Instead of writing multiple times same configurations for different project you can write one template
                  so that you can reuse this template across different projects.
3. Collaborating: It helps to build the infra very faster and also helps in executing different tasks independently
4. Versioning:    By using this we can avoid any mistakes while deploying moreover modules can have their own versioning
                  which helps is in managing and updating the infrastructure.
5. Scalability:   In future if you want to add some more feature to your existing modules you can scale them by creating
                  new modules for the infrastructure.
